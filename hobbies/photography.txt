#Photography

I first got into photography in high school, and it quickly became my favorite
class outside of the sciences. I also really connected with my teacher, who 
spent a lot of time helping me learn how to use editing tools to enhance 
images with a light touch—improving them without overdoing it.

I’ve kept that interest over the years, though I drifted away from shooting 
regularly for a while. About three years ago, when my wife and I were thinking
about having a child, I picked the camera back up with a new purpose: to 
document our home and the everyday details of life—moments I’d want to share 
with our future family.

Now that we have our firstborn, Ada, my focus has expanded into videography 
as well. These days I shoot both photo and video on a Fujifilm X100VI.
